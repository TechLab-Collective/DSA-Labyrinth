## Multilingual Data Structures & Algorithms Repository

Welcome to **DSA Labyrinth**, your go-to open-source repository for exploring and contributing data structures and algorithms in multiple programming languages.

## 🌐 Supported Languages

- Python
- Java
- C++
- JavaScript
- Go
- C#

Each language has its own folder structured with:

- `data_structures/`: Classic and advanced data structure implementations
- `algorithms/`: Sorting, searching, recursion, graphs, and more
- `tests/`: Unit tests to ensure correctness and maintainability

## 🧠 Why DSA Labyrinth?

- One repo to learn and compare DSA implementations across languages
- Beginner-friendly and well-structured for easy contributions
- Perfect for interview prep, CS students, or open-source contributors
