# DSA Labyrinth Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development and contribution phases for the **DSA Labyrinth** project. Each phase focuses on enhancing multilingual DSA coverage, benchmarks, visualizations, and community engagement.

---

## Phase 1: Core Setup & Language Bootstrapping ‚úÖ

- [x] Initialize repo structure
- [x] Set up folders for Python, Java, C++, JS, Go
- [x] Add basic data structures (Array, LinkedList, Stack, Queue) in each language
- [x] Include basic sorting/searching algorithms

## Phase 2: Intermediate DSA Coverage üöß

- [ ] Add Trees (Binary Tree, BST, Heap, Trie)
- [ ] Add Graph algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, A\*)
- [ ] Add Recursion and Backtracking problems
- [ ] Add unit tests for all Phase 1 & 2 algorithms

## Phase 3: Benchmarks & Comparisons üî¨

- [ ] Write benchmark scripts for each algorithm in every language
- [ ] Visualize time/space complexity comparisons
- [ ] Document observations in `/benchmarks/README.md`

## Phase 4: Visualizations üìä

- [ ] Create SVG or GIF visualizations for selected algorithms
- [ ] Embed visuals into respective algorithm README files
- [ ] Add interactive JS visualizations for the web

## Phase 5: Community & Contributions ü§ù

- [ ] Write clear `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- [ ] Tag good first issues
- [ ] Run first contributor hackathon
- [ ] Feature top contributors in README
